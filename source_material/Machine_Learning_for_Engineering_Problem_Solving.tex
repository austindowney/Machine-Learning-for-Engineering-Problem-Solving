\section{Preface}
\vspace{-1ex}
This text is a practical, example-driven guide to introduce classical machine learning techniques using the {\tt{scikit-learn}} library designed for engineers with limited to no programming experience. This preface collects the essential housekeeping information for using this text.

\subsection{Programming in Python}
\vspace{-1ex}
This text uses Python programmed though the Spyder IDE managed through the Anaconda platform for the examples, leveraging the {\tt{scikit-learn}} library to explain the topics discussed. To assist readers of the text, a six part video series that walks the practitioner though this combination of IDE and distribution manager is provided as a playlist  \href{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-2wJog-EC5-wQQUdpc8MjztKZ1kE2ATS}{here}.

\subsection{Cover Art}
\vspace{-1ex}
The cover image, is a mid-1930s International Harvester C-series truck. Built between 1934 and 1936 at the company's Springfield Works in Springfield, Ohio. Roughly 80,000 C-series trucks where made during this short time. The C-series was International's first line to feature an all-steel cab and a host of mechanical upgrades over the prior W-series. This truck was photographed by Ethan McNeese on Washington Island in Door County, Wisconsin in 2021.

The truck on the cover underscores the simple idea that a machine's purpose is to turn raw input into useful work. The same principle drives machine learning, where digital ``machines'' transform data into insight and data-informed actions.
